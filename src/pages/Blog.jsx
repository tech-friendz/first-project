                <p>There are so many modern, luxurious and budget friendly brands in jewelry fashion industry that offer beautiful designs to wear in everyday life and during important occasions. But among all these mess I’ve always felt a respectable magnetism towards Cartier, which seems to be epitome of elegance, beauty, uniqueness, charm and timelessness. And Cartier slogan stands for its driven force “Never imitate, always innovate”. Cartier style much owes to its attitude towards jewelry design combining old artifacts with modern style. That’s why every single piece has its story to tell and style to impose. There is so much to speak about this legendary brand, but I’ve chosen a few of them to share.</p>

            <p className={styles.subTitle}>1. Why wildcat and panther?</p>

            <div className={styles.subtitleContent}>
                Wildcat and especially panther jewelry is a distinguishing signature of the Cartier. Panther has penetrated into all type of jewelry pieces: bracelets, rings, earrings, brooches, even home décor. Where is the inspiration coming from? I’ve heard different opinions on this but recently I came across an explanation in Cartier family member Francesca Cartier Brickell’s book “The Cartiers”. In 1914 first motives of panther were used by Jack Cartier. He always admired these animals in India, but later, reading “The Jungle Book” for his son, he came across with an illustration of Bagira and was driven to create sketches of wildcat in his journals and later in the designs of jewelry boxes and watches. Decades after his death Cartier designer Jane Thissen made panther as the symbol of influential women։ strong, vigorous, frightening. Panther reached higher recognition when in 1948 Duke of Windzor ordered a brooch clip with onyx panther with 116.74 carat emerald.

                One year later Duchess ordered the second brooch; panther with diamond pave' with sapphire spots and yellow diamond eyes sitting on a 152.35ct sapphire cabochon. Started from these orders, panther found its reflection in all the other Cartier jewelry designs.
